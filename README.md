 Ransomware Incident Response Simulation (Wazuh SIEM)

Project Overview
This project demonstrates a full ransomware incident response simulation using Wazuh SIEM and a Windows 10 endpoint, mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

The objective is to showcase real-world SOC analyst and Blue Team skills, including detection, investigation, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident analysis.

This project is designed for entry to mid-level SOC / Blue Team roles

Objectives
 Detect ransomware-related activity using Wazuh SIEM
 Analyze endpoint telemetry and security alerts
 Map attacker behavior to the MITRE ATT&CK framework
 Build a full ransomware kill chain timeline
 Perform structured Incident Response (IR)
 Produce professional SOC documentation

Ransomware Kill Chain (MITRE ATT&CK Mapping)

Phase | MITRE Tactic | Technique ID | Description 
 Initial Access | Initial Access | T1078 | Valid Accounts (Simulated) 
 Execution | Execution | T1059 | PowerShell Execution 
 Persistence | Persistence | T1547 | Autostart Execution (Monitored) 
 Privilege Escalation | Privilege Escalation | T1068 | Exploitation (Not Observed) 
 Defense Evasion | Defense Evasion | T1562 | Impair Defenses 
 Discovery | Discovery | T1083 | File & Directory Discovery 
 Impact | Impact | T1486 | Data Encrypted for Impact 
 Command & Control | Command and Control | T1071 | Application Layer Protocol (Monitored) 

Incident Response Workflow
Identification
 Suspicious PowerShell execution detected
 File Integrity Monitoring alerts indicated mass file modification
 Incident classified as Ransomware

Containment
 Infected endpoint isolated from the network (manual simulation)
 Log collection maintained for forensic evidence

 Eradication
 Malicious artifacts identified and removed (simulated)
 Compromised credentials reset

 Recovery
 Endpoint marked for reimaging
 System restoration from clean backup (simulated)

 Post-Incident Review
 Lessons learned documented
 Detection and monitoring improvements recommended

Incident Summary
Incident Type:Ransomware
Affected Host: Windows 10 Endpoint
Detection Tool: Wazuh SIEM
MITRE Impact Technique: T1486 – Data Encrypted for Impact
Status: Resolved
